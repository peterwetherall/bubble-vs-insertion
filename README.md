# bubble-vs-insertion
A program to graphically compare the bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms.

I created this after being set a challenge in my A Level Computer Science class.

The algorithm calculates the time taken for a random list of size *n* (1-10,000 on the x-axis) to be sorted using both the bubble sort and insertion sort techniques.

The graph lines have a low opacity, so many can be overlayed and a line of best fit easily found.
